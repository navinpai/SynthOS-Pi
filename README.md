SynthOS-Pi
=========


###### What?
Trying to port SynthOS generated RTOS to the Raspberry-Pi

###### Why?
Why Not? :-P

Seriously though, SynthOS generates some pretty well optimised RTOS code, and takes the load off of developing an entire RTOS from scratch off the developer. The RasPi is an astoundingly amazing device, and together SynthOS and RasPi seem like a killer combo

###### How?
Simply replace the kernel.img file on the RasPi SD card with the bin file generated by the code examples in the repo (You'll have to rename the bin file generated to kernel.img). Make sure you save the original kernel.img file somewhere though.

###### Who?
It's two of us working on this right now. Navin Pai and Chirag Saraiya. We're both Graduate students at IIIT-Bangalore. Would love to have more contributors. :)

###### Will this work?
We test out our code on the Raspberry Pi Model B, and can kinda, sorta guarentee it'll work for you too. But obviously, everything is very hacky at the moment.

###### Thanks
Huge thanks to David Welch, whose project (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi) served as a starting point for everything we've done. We've shamelessly picked up some of his code as well, and his repo has been amazingly helpful for understanding the nitty gritties of the RasPi
